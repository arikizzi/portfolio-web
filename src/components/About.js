        Hi, this side Arihant. I am Blockchain Developer who loves to code and
        spend time learning about new and evolving technologies.
        <br />
        <br />
        I started with the very basics of Web Development and made good progress
        in this niche. I like working with the front end and prefer ReactJS to
        develop it.
        <br />
        <br />
        To be very honest, I have tried my hands on many techs, but lately, I
        have grown my interest in this highly unique technology of Blockchain.
        The concepts are very fresh and actual.
        <br />
        <br />
        For Blockchain, I started by reading blogs and watching YouTube to know
        how it works then I jumped into building Smart Contracts with Solidity.
        Believe me, it is fun!
        <br />
        <br />
        I have a great interest in coding as well and I prefer JAVA for it. I
        have also developed Java Applications using JavaFX, and Swing.
        <br />
        <br />
        My skills include JAVA, C++, Python, Solidity, HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
        ReactJS, NodeJS, and SQL.
        <br />
        <br />
        That is it. Peace!
      </p>
